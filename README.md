Kata here: http://kata-log.rocks/tic-tac-toe-kata.

Completed whilst applying Object Calisthenics during the [Codurance Apprenticeship](www.codurance.com).

### Object Calisthenics outlines 9 basic rules to apply when performing the exercise:

- One level of indentation per method.
- Don't use the ELSE keyword.
- Wrap all primitives and Strings in classes.
- First class collections.
- One dot per line.
- Don't abbreviate.
- Keep all classes less than 50 lines.
- No classes with more than two instance variables.
- No getters or setters.
